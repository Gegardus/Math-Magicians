      There are two types of mind.. the mathematical, and what might be called
      the intuitive. The former arrives at its views slowly, but they are firm
      and rigid; the latter is endowed with greater flexibility and applies
      itself simultaneously to the diverse lovable parts of that which it loves.

    <p className="home-quote">
      When intuition and logic agree, you are always right.. Our notion of
      symmetry is derived from the human face. Hence, we demand symmetry
      horizontally and in breadth only, not vertically nor in depth.
