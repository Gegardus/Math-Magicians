# Math Magicians

> "Math magicians" is a website for all fans of mathematics. It is a Single Page App (SPA) that allows users to make simple calculations. In this fourth part of the project, the Calculator component developed in previous projects has been redesigned. Instead of using class-based components, hooks are now used.
